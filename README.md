# ItemRestrictions ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Akulation/ItemRestrictions/total?color=green&style=flat-square)
Unturned Rocketmod Plugin that lets you restrict items

# Features
- You can create and remove restrictions using commands ingame, no need to configure any files!
- You can make as many restrictions as you want and each of them can have a different permission!
- Instead of deleting items like many other restrictor plugins, it simply leaves the item on the ground!
- No MySQL required! It saves all restrictions in a JSON file.

## Commands / Permissions
- `/restrict <ItemID> <Permission>` | `restrict`
- `/unrestrict <ItemID>` | `unrestrict`
 
## Configuration
